## Synthesis

Our project consists in visualizing the evolution of the proportion of death and the number of deaths according to the causes and countries of the world, and visualizing the most deadly causes.  

We have achieved:  

 * an interactive map of the world that allows to select one or more causes of death, a period of years and a display method to visualize mortality rates in different countries.  
 * a scatterplot that allows to visualize among other things the correlations between two causes of mortalities.  
 * two visualizations, one that allows to see the evolution of the number of deaths for the selected countries, and the other that allows to see the ranking of causes according to the countries.
